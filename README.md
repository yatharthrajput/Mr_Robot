# Mr_Robot
## elpscrk
A Common User Passwords generator script that looks like the tool(elpscrk) that Eliot used it in Mr.Robot xD
ps:It's better the cupp tool because it generates all the possible passwords that cupp doesn't generates

# Installation
https://github.com/yatharthrajput/Mr_Robot_password_genrator.git

# Usage
Just open the script and type the info you know as in the screenshot and as Eliot did in MrRobot
